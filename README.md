# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project 

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

- Download the raw data and load them to the datasets,
- Merge training and test datasets,
- Keep only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation, 
- Add the activity names to the data to make them more readable, 
- Make the variables more descriptive, 
- Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidy_data.txt.
